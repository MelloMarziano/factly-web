  // Actually, usually "whatsapp.png" is the full logo. Let's see.
  // If I make background transparent, I rely on the image.
  // Let's keep the green background for safety unless the image covers it.
  // Better yet, let's assume the image is just the white logo or the full colored logo.
  // If it's the full colored logo, we don't need the background-color.
  // Let's try to remove background and just show the image, assuming it's a nice button-like icon.
  // If it's just the symbol, we might need the background.
  // Safest bet: Check if I can see the image... I can't.
  // I'll stick to the previous style but put the image inside.
